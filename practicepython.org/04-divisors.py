"""
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list
of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it
is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a
divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

    by the user
    :rtype: list
